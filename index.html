    <h1>Privacy Policy – MyCalmSync</h1>
    <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> February 16, 2026</p>

    <p>This Privacy Policy describes how MyCalmSync (“we,” “us,” or “our”) collects, uses, discloses, and safeguards information when you use the MyCalmSync mobile application (the “App”). MyCalmSync is independently owned and operated by its creator.</p>

    <p>Your account information and user-generated content are securely stored using Supabase, a trusted backend service provider. Passwords are hashed and cannot be accessed by us. Reasonable administrative, technical, and physical safeguards are in place to protect your data. However, no method of electronic storage or transmission over the Internet is completely secure, so absolute security cannot be guaranteed.</p>

      <li>With Supabase, solely to operate and maintain the App</li>
      <li>If required by law, regulation, or legal process</li>
      <li>To protect rights, safety, or prevent fraud</li>
    </ul>
    <p>All service providers are required to safeguard information appropriately.</p>

    <h2>5. User-Generated Content & Community Features</h2>
    <p>Content published in community spaces may be visible to other users. Users are responsible for the information they voluntarily share. We reserve the right to moderate or remove content that violates community standards.</p>

    <h2>6. Data Retention</h2>
    <p>We retain personal information only as long as necessary to:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Provide services</li>
      <li>Comply with legal obligations</li>
